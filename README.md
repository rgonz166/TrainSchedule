# TrainSchedule
A Train Schedule Tracker
Displays the name of the train, where it is headed, how often the train passes by, and how much longer until the train passes by.

### How to add new train schedule
1. Enter in the name of the train.
2. Enter the destination of the train
3. Enter time of the first train
4. Enter how often the train passes in minutes
